Refactor plugin
====

This is a very basic plugin that provides these things:

 * Generate test stubs for all public methods of Models and Controllers

   ./script/generate model_test user
   ./script/generate controller_test account

 * Find views that do not correspond to a controller action

   rake find_unused_views

   app/views/account/list.rhtml
   app/views/account/new.rhtml
   app/views/account/show.rhtml
