AnnotateSchema
==============

Add a comment summarizing the current schema to the top
of each ActiveRecord model source file:

  # Schema as of Sun Feb 26 21:58:32 CST 2006 (schema version 7)
  #
  #  id                  :integer(11)   not null
  #  quantity            :integer(11)   
  #  product_id          :integer(11)   
  #  unit_price          :float         
  #  order_id            :integer(11)   
  #

  class LineItem < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :product
  
    . . .
  
Does not cope with models in sub-directories of app/models.
