Acts as Attachment
=====================

Acts as Attachment allows you to specify that a model accepts file uploads and stores the necessary meta info (filename, size, etc).

See http://technoweenie.stikipad.com/plugins/show/Acts+as+Attachment for some documentation.

Now, with simple generator!

This is still under heavy development, so look at test/fixtures/attachment.rb for example usage
