Has_A_Collection
======================================================
The "Has A Collection" plugin allows you to extend a model to afford other models to collect to it.
The advantage of has_a_collection over the :through option in has_many is that the associations can be polymorphic on both ends.
The HasACollection module transparently handles the implicit joins between the two models.

Example Usage
======================================================

# Creates @reader.blogs
class Reader < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_a_collection :of => ["blogs"]
end

# Creates @blogs.feeds, @blogs.newspapers
# Allows only the Reader class to subscribe to the Blog class.
class Blogs < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_a_collection :of => ["feeds","newspapers"],
  is_collected :by => ["readers"]
end

# Allows only the Blog class to subscribe to the Feed class.
class Feed < ActiveRecord::Base
  is_collected :by => ["blogs"]
end
  

Install
=======================================================
To install create this migration.

class AddActsAsSubscribable < ActiveRecord::Migration
  create_table "subscriptions", :force => true do |t|
    t.column "subscriber_id", :integer
    t.column "subscriber_type", :string
    t.column "subscribed_to_id", :integer
    t.column "subscribed_to_type", :string

end
