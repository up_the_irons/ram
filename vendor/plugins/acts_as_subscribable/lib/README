Acts_As_Subscribable
======================================================
Acts as subscribable allows you to extend a model to afford other models to subscribe to it.
The advantage of acts_as_subscribable over the :through option in has_many is that the associations can be polymorphic on both ends.
The subscribable module transparently handles the implicit joins between the two models.

Example Usage
======================================================

# Creates @reader.blogs
class Reader < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_subscribable :subscribe_to => ["blogs"]
end

# Creates @blogs.feeds, @blogs.newspapers
# Allows only the Reader class to subscribe to the Blog class.
class Blogs < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_subscribable :subscribe_to => ["feeds","newspapers"], :allow_subscriptions_from => ["readers"]
end

# Allows only the Blog class to subscribe to the Feed class.
class Feed < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_subscribable :allow_subscriptions_from => ["blogs"]
end
  

Install
=======================================================
To install create this migration.

class AddActsAsSubscribable < ActiveRecord::Migration

    t.column "subscriber_id", :integer
